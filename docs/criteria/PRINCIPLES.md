# Principles
## Overview
 - Beta internally QA complete; RC externally QA complete.
 - Documentation quality should match code quality standard.

## Per Level
### Alpha
- Code complete at quality benchmark for most basic, valuable functionality.
- Limitations & edge case failures expected.

### Beta
  - Functionally complete.
  - Satisfies minimal performance bar. Resource efficiency (memory, CPU, and I/O usage) is measured.
  - Metrics & tracing in place for observability.

### RC
  - Ready for production: security & privacy
  - Performance tested at scale
  - Feature complete; API stable.
  - Component ensure correctness.

### Stable
  - Verified in production.
