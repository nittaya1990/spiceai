# Spice v1.0-rc.2 (Dec 16, 2024)

Spice v1.0.0-rc.2 is the second release candidate for the first major version of Spice.ai OSS. This release continues to build on the stability of Spice for production use, including key Data Connector graduations, bug fixes, and AI features.

## Highlights in v1.0-rc.2

- **MS SQL and File Data Connectors:** Graduated from Alpha to Beta.

- **GraphQL and Databricks Delta Lake Data Connectors:** Graduated from Beta to Release Candidate.

- **gospice SDK Release:** The [Spice Go SDK has updated to v7.0](https://github.com/spiceai/gospice/releases), adding support for refreshing datasets and upgrading dependencies.

- **Azure AI Support:** Added support for both LLMs and embedding models. Example `spicepod.yml` configuration:

```yaml
embeddings:
  - name: azure
    from: azure:text-embedding-3-small
    params:
      endpoint: https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com
      azure_api_version: 2024-08-01-preview
      azure_deployment_name: text-embedding-3-small
      azure_api_key: ${ secrets:SPICE_AZURE_API_KEY }
models:
  - name: azure
    from: azure:gpt-4o-mini
    params:
      endpoint: https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com
      azure_api_version: 2024-08-01-preview
      azure_deployment_name: gpt-4o-mini
      azure_api_key: ${ secrets:SPICE_AZURE_TOKEN }
```

**Accelerate subsets of columns:** Spice now supports acceleration for specific columns from a federated source. Specify the desired columns directly in the [Refresh SQL](https://docs.spiceai.org/components/data-accelerators/data-refresh#refresh-sql) for more selective and efficient data acceleration.

Example `spicepod.yaml` configuration:

```yaml
datasets:
  - from: s3://spiceai-demo-datasets/taxi_trips/2024/
    name: taxi_trips
    params:
      file_format: parquet
    acceleration:
      refresh_sql: SELECT tpep_pickup_datetime, tpep_dropoff_datetime, trip_distance, total_amount FROM taxi_trips
```

## Breaking changes

**Sharepoint Authentication Parameters:** now use access tokens instead of authorization codes, using the `sharepoint_bearer_token` parameter. The `sharepoint_auth_code` parameter has been removed.

**Data Connector Delimiters:** now support `/` and `://`, in addition to `:` in the `from` parameter of the dataset configuration. The following examples are equivalent:

- `from: postgres://my_postgres_table`
- `from: postgres/my_postgres_table`
- `from: postgres:my_postgres_table`

Some data connectors, such as `s3` which only accepts `://`, place further restrictions on the allowed delimiter.

The `file` data connector has changed how it interprets the `://` delimiter to reflect how most other URL parsers work, i.e. `file://my_file_path`. Previously, the file path was interpreted as `/my_file_path`. Now, it is interpreted as a relative path, i.e. `my_file_path`.

**Spice Search limit:** is now applied to the final search result, instead of previously being applied separately to each dataset involved in a search before aggregation.
