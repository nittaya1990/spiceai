# Spice v1.0-rc.5 (Jan 13, 2025)

Spice v1.0.0-rc.5 is the fifth release candidate for the first major version of Spice.ai OSS. This release focuses production readiness and critical bug fixes. In addition, a new DynamoDB data connector has been added along with automatic detection for GPU acceleration when running Spice using the CLI.

## Highlights in v1.0-rc.5

- **Automatic GPU Acceleration Detection:** Automatically detect and utilize GPU acceleration when running by CLI. Install AI components locally using the CLI command `spice install ai`. Currently supports NVIdia CUDA and Apple Metal (M-series).

- **DynamoDB Data Connector:** Query AWS DynamoDB tables using SQL with the new DynamoDB Data Connector.

```yaml
datasets:
  - from: dynamodb:users
    name: users
    params:
      dynamodb_aws_region: us-west-2
      dynamodb_aws_access_key_id: ${secrets:aws_access_key_id}
      dynamodb_aws_secret_access_key: ${secrets:aws_secret_access_key}
    acceleration:
      enabled: true
```

```console
sql> describe users;
+----------------+-----------+-------------+
| column_name    | data_type | is_nullable |
+----------------+-----------+-------------+
| created_at     | Utf8      | YES         |
| date_of_birth  | Utf8      | YES         |
| email          | Utf8      | YES         |
| account_status | Utf8      | YES         |
| updated_at     | Utf8      | YES         |
| full_name      | Utf8      | YES         |
| ...                                      |
+----------------+-----------+-------------+
```

- **File Data Connector:** Graduated to [Stable](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/blob/trunk/docs/criteria/stable/rc.md).

- **Dremio Data Connector:** Graduated to [Release Candidate (RC)](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/blob/trunk/docs/criteria/connectors/rc.md).

- **Spice.ai, Spark, and Snowflake Data Connectors:** Graduated to [Beta](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/blob/trunk/docs/criteria/connectors/beta.md).
