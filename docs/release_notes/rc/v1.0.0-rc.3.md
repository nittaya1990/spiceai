# Spice v1.0-rc.3 (Dec 30, 2024)

Spice v1.0.0-rc.3 is the third release candidate for the first major version of Spice.ai OSS. This release continues the focus on production readiness and includes new Iceberg Catalog APIs, DuckDB improvements, and a new Iceberg Catalog Connector.

## Highlights in v1.0-rc.3

- **Iceberg Catalog APIs:** Spice now functions as an Iceberg Catalog provider, implementing a core subset of the [Iceberg Catalog APIs](https://iceberg.apache.org/concepts/catalog#decoupling-using-the-rest-catalog). This enables Iceberg Catalog clients native discovery of datasets and schemas through Spice APIs.

- `GET /v1/namespaces` - List all catalogs registered in Spice.
- `GET /v1/namespaces?parent=catalog` - List schemas registered under a given catalog.
- `GET /v1/namespaces/:catalog_schema/tables` - List tables registered under a given schema.
- `GET /v1/namespaces/:catalog_schema/tables/:table` - Get the schema of a given table.

- **Iceberg Catalog Connector:** The [Iceberg Catalog Connector](https://docs.spiceai.org/components/catalogs/iceberg) is a new integration to discover and query datasets from a remote Iceberg Catalog.

Example connecting to a remote Iceberg Catalog with tables stored in S3:

```yaml
catalogs:
  - from: iceberg:https://my-iceberg-catalog.com/v1/namespaces
    name: ice
    params:
      iceberg_s3_access_key_id: ${secrets:ICEBERG_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID}
      iceberg_s3_secret_access_key: ${secrets:ICEBERG_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}
      iceberg_s3_region: us-east-1
```

View the [Iceberg Catalog Connector documentation](https://docs.spiceai.org/components/catalogs/iceberg) for more details.

- **DuckDB Improvements:** Added `cosine_distance` support for DuckDB-backed vector search, improved `unnest` nested type handling for `array_element` and lists, and optimized query performance.

- **SQLite Data Accelerator:** Graduated to [Release Candidate (RC)](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/blob/trunk/docs/criteria/accelerators/rc.md).

- **File Data Accelerator:** Graduated to [Release Candidate (RC)](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/blob/trunk/docs/criteria/accelerators/rc.md).

## Breaking changes

- API:`v1/datasets/sample` has been removed as it is not particularly useful, can be replicated via SQL, and via the tools endpoint `POST v1/tools/:name`.

## Cookbook

- New [Language Model Evals Recipe](https://github.com/spiceai/cookbook/blob/trunk/evals/README.md) showing how to measure the performance of a language model using LLM-as-Judge, configured entirely in the spice runtime.

- New [Iceberg Catalog Recipe](https://github.com/spiceai/cookbook/blob/trunk/catalogs/iceberg/README.md) showing how to use Spice to query Iceberg tables from an Iceberg catalog.

## Dependencies

- [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/): Upgraded from 0.26.0 to 0.27.1
- [Go](https://go.dev/): Upgraded from 1.22 to 1.23 (CLI)
