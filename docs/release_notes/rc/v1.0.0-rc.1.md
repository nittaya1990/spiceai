# Spice v1.0-rc.1 (Nov 27, 2024)

Spice v1.0.0-rc.1 marks the release candidate for the first major version of Spice.ai OSS. This milestone includes key Connector and Accelerator graduations and bug fixes, positioning Spice for a stable and production-ready release.

## Highlights in v1.0-rc.1

**API Key Authentication:** Spice now supports optional authentication for API endpoints via configurable API keys, for additional security and control over runtime access.

Example Spicepod.yml configuration:

```yaml
runtime:
  auth:
    api-key:
      enabled: true
      keys:
        - ${ secrets:api_key } # Load from a secret store
        - my-api-key # Or specify directly
```

Usage:

- HTTP API: Include the API key in the `X-API-Key` header.
- Flight SQL: Use the API key in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token.
- Spice CLI: Provide the `--api-key` flag for CLI commands.

For more details on using API Key auth, refer to the [API Auth documentation](https://docs.spiceai.org/api/auth).

**DuckDB Data Connector:** Has graduated from Beta to Release Candidate.

**Arrow and DuckDB Data Accelerators:** Both have graduated from Beta to Release Candidates.

**Debezium Kafka Integration:** Spice now supports secure authentication and encryption options for Kafka connections when using Debezium for Change Data Capture (CDC). The previous limitation of PLAINTEXT protocol-only connections has been lifted. Spice now supports the following Kafka security configurations:

- Security protocol: PLAINTEXT, SSL, SASL_PLAINTEXT, SASL_SSL
- SASL mechanisms: PLAIN, SCRAM-SHA-256, SCRAM-SHA-512

Example Spicepod.yml configuration:

```yaml
datasets:
  - from: debezium:my_kafka_topic_with_debezium_changes
    name: my_dataset
    params:
      kafka_security_protocol: SASL_SSL
      kafka_sasl_mechanism: SCRAM-SHA-512
      kafka_sasl_username: kafka
      kafka_sasl_password: ${secrets:kafka_sasl_password}
      kafka_ssl_ca_location: ./certs/kafka_ca_cert.pem
```

## Breaking changes

**Model Parameters:** The `params.spice_tools` parameter has been replaced by `params.tools`. Backward compatibility is maintained for existing configurations using `params.spice_tools`.

**Dataset Accelerator State:** The `ready_state` parameter has been moved to the dataset level.

**Ready Handler Response:** The response body of the `/v1/ready` handler has been changed from `Ready` (uppercase) to `ready` (lowercase) for consistency and adherence to standards.

**Default Kafka Security for Debezium:** The default Kafka `kafka_security_protocol` parameter for Debezium datasets has changed from `PLAINTEXT` to `SASL_SSL`, improving security by default.

**Metrics Name Updates:** Adjustments have been made to specific metrics for improved observability and accuracy:
