# Spice v1.0.1 (Jan 27, 2024)

Spice v1.0.1 focuses on an improved developer experience, with automatic CUDA GPU detection for local models, in addition to bug fixes. Notably, the Iceberg Catalog Connector now supports AWS Glue including Sig v4 authentication.

## Highlights in v1.0.1

- **AWS Glue Support for Iceberg Catalog Connector**: The [Iceberg Catalog Connector](https://spiceai.org/docs/components/catalogs/iceberg) now supports AWS Glue. Example spicepod.yaml configuration:

```yaml
- from: iceberg:https://glue.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/iceberg/v1/catalogs/123456789012/namespaces
  name: glue
```

- **`spice upgrade` CLI Command:** The `spice upgrade` CLI command detects more edge cases for a smoother upgrade experience.

- **GPU Acceleration Detection**: The Spice CLI now automatically detects and enables CUDA (NVIDIA GPUs) GPU acceleration when supported in addition to Metal (M-Series on macOS).

- **Python SDK:** The Python SDK (`spicepy`) has [updated to v3.0.0](https://github.com/spiceai/spicepy/releases/tag/v3.0.0), aligning the SDK with the Runtime
