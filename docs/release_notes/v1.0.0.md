# Spice v1.0-stable (Jan 20, 2025)

ðŸŽ‰ After 47 releases, Spice.ai OSS has reached production readiness with the 1.0-stable milestone!

The core runtime and features such as query federation, query acceleration, catalog integration, search and AI-inference have all graduated to stable status along with key component graduations across data connectors, data accelerators, catalog connectors, and AI model providers.

## Highlights in v1.0-stable

- **Stable Data Connectors:** The following data connectors have graduated to [Stable](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/blob/trunk/docs/criteria/connectors/stable.md):

  - [Delta Lake](https://spiceai.org/docs/components/data-connectors/delta-lake)
  - [MySQL](https://spiceai.org/docs/components/data-connectors/mysql)
  - [Dremio](https://spiceai.org/docs/components/data-connectors/dremio)
  - [PostgreSQL](https://spiceai.org/docs/components/data-connectors/postgres)
  - [Databricks (mode: delta_lake)](https://spiceai.org/docs/components/data-connectors/databricks)
  - [DuckDB](https://spiceai.org/docs/components/data-connectors/duckdb)
  - [S3](https://spiceai.org/docs/components/data-connectors/s3)

- **Stable Data Accelerators:** The following data accelerators have graduated to [Stable](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/blob/trunk/docs/criteria/accelerators/stable.md):

  - [DuckDB](https://spiceai.org/docs/components/data-accelerators/duckdb)
  - [Arrow](https://spiceai.org/docs/components/data-accelerators/arrow)

- **Unity Catalog Connector:** Graduated to [Stable](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/blob/trunk/docs/criteria/catalogs/stable.md).

- **Databricks (mode: spark_connect) Data Connector:** Graduated to [Beta](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/blob/trunk/docs/criteria/connectors/beta.md).

- **Beta Catalog Connectors:** The Iceberg and Databricks catalog connectors graduated to [Beta](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/blob/trunk/docs/criteria/catalogs/beta.md).

- **OpenAI Model & Embeddings Provider:** Graduated to [Release Candidate (RC)](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/blob/trunk/docs/criteria/models/rc.md).

- **Alpha Model Providers:** The Anthropic and xAI (Grok) model providers graduated to [Alpha](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/blob/trunk/docs/criteria/models/alpha.md).

## Breaking Changes

- **Default Runtime Version:** The CLI will install the GPU accelerated AI-capable Runtime by default (if supported), when running `spice install` or `spice run`. To force-install the non-GPU version, run `spice install ai --cpu`.

- **Default OpenAI Model:** The default OpenAI model has updated to `gpt-4o-mini`.

- **Identifier Normalization:** Unquoted identifiers such as table names are no longer normalized to lowercase. Identifiers will now retain their exact case as provided.

- **Sandboxed Docker Image:** The Runtime Docker Image now runs the `spiced` process as the `nobody` user in a minimal [chroot sandbox](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/network-security-hacks/0596006438/ch01s11.html).

- **Insecure S3 and ABFS endpoints:** The S3 and ABFS connectors now enforce insecure endpoint checks, preventing HTTP endpoints unless `allow_http` is explicitly enabled. Refer to [the documentation](https://spiceai.org/docs/components/data-connectors/s3#params) for details.
