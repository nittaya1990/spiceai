# Spice v1.0.2 (Feb 4, 2024)

Spice v1.0.2 adds support for running local filesystem-hosted DeepSeek models including R1 (cloud-hosted via DeepSeek API was already supported) and improves the developer experience for debugging AI chat tasks along with several bug fixes. The HuggingFace and Filesystem-Hosted models providers have both graduated to Release Candidates (RC) and the Spice.ai Cloud Platform catalog provider has graduated to Beta.

## Highlights in v1.0.2

- **spice trace** New `spice trace` CLI command that outputs a detailed breakdown of traces and tasks, including tool usage and AI completions.

Examples:

```shell
trace> spice trace ai_chat
[61cc6bd0e571c783] ( 2593.77ms) ai_chat
  ├── [69362c30f238076f] (    0.36ms) tool_use::get_readiness
  ├── [b6b17f1a9a6b86dc] (  982.21ms) ai_completion
  ├── [c30d692c6c41c5ee] (    0.06ms) tool_use::list_datasets
  └── [ce18756d5fef0df0] ( 1605.12ms) ai_completion

trace> spice trace ai_chat --trace-id 61cc6bd0e571c783

trace> spice trace ai_chat --id chatcmpl-AvXwmPSV1PMyGBi9dLfkEQTZPjhqz
```

The `spice trace` CLI simply outputs data available in the `runtime.task_history` table which can also be queried by SQL.
