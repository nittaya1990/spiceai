# Spice v0.20.0-beta (Nov 04, 2024)

Spice v0.20.0-beta improves federated query performance with column pruning and adds support for Metal (Apple Silicon) and CUDA (NVidia) accelerators. The S3, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and GitHub Data Connectors have graduated from Beta to Release Candidates. The Arrow, DuckDB, and SQLite Data Accelerators have graduated from Alpha to Beta.

## Highlights in v0.20.0-beta

**Data Connectors:** The `S3`, `PostgreSQL`, `MySQL`, and `GitHub` Data Connectors have graduated from `beta` to `release candidate`.

**Data Accelerators:** The `Arrow`, `DuckDB`, and `SQLite` Data Accelerators have graduated from `alpha` to `beta`.

**Metal and CUDA Support:** Added support for Metal (Apple Silicon) and CUDA (NVidia) for AI/ML workloads including embeddings and local LLM inference.

For instructions on compiling a Meta or CUDA binary, see the [Installation Docs](https://docs.spiceai.org/installation).

## Breaking Changes

- The ODBC Data Connector now requires ODBC drivers specified in connection strings are registered in the system ODBC driver manager.

Example invalid connection string:

```bash
DRIVER={/path/to/driver.so};SERVER=localhost;DATABASE=master
```

Example valid connection string:

```bash
DRIVER={My ODBC Driver};SERVER=localhost;DATABASE=master
```

Where `My ODBC Driver` is the name of an ODBC driver registered in the ODBC driver manager.
