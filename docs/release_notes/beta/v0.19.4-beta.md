# Spice v0.19.4 (Oct 30, 2024)

Spice v0.19.4-beta introduces a new `localpod` Data Connector, improvements to accelerator resiliency and control, and a new configuration to control when accelerated datasets are considered ready.

## Highlights in v0.19.4

**`localpod` Connector**: Implement a "tiered" acceleration strategy with a new `localpod` Data Connector that can be used to accelerate datasets from other datasets registered in Spice.

```yaml
datasets:
  - from: s3://my_bucket/my_dataset
    name: my_dataset
    acceleration:
      enabled: true
      engine: duckdb
      mode: file
      refresh_check_interval: 60s
  - from: localpod:my_dataset
    name: my_localpod_dataset
    acceleration:
      enabled: true
```

Refreshes on the `localpod`'s parent dataset will automatically be synchronized with the `localpod` dataset.

**Improved Accelerator Resiliency**: When Spice is restarted, if the federated source for a dataset configured with a file-based accelerator is not available, the dataset will still load from the existing file data and will attempt to connect to the federated source in the background for future refreshes.

**Accelerator Ready State**: Control when an accelerated dataset is considered "ready" by the runtime with the new `ready_state` parameter.

```yaml
datasets:
  - from: s3://my_bucket/my_dataset
    name: my_dataset
    acceleration:
      enabled: true
      ready_state: on_load # or on_registration
```

- `ready_state: on_load`: Default. The dataset is considered ready after the initial load of the accelerated data. For file-based accelerated datasets that have existing data, this means the dataset is ready immediately.
- `ready_state: on_registration`: The dataset is considered ready when the dataset is registered in Spice. Queries against this dataset before the data is loaded will fallback to the federated source.

## Breaking changes

Accelerated datasets configured with `ready_state: on_load` (the default behavior) that are not ready will return an error instead of returning zero results.
