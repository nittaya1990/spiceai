Spice v0.19.3-beta improves the performance and stability of data connectors and accelerators, including faster queries across multiple federated sources by optimizing how filters are applied. Anthropic has also been added as a LLM model provider.

## Highlights in v0.19.3

**DataFusion Fixes**: Resolved bugs in DataFusion and DataFusion Table Providers, expanding TPC-DS coverage and correctness.

**GitHub Data Connector Beta Milestone:** The [GitHub Data Connector](https://docs.spiceai.org/components/data-connectors/github) has graduated to Beta after extensive testing, stability, and performance improvements.

**Anthropic Models Provider:** [Anthropic](https://docs.spiceai.org/components/models/anthropic) has been added as an LLM provider, including support for streaming.
