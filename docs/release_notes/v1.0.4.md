# Spice v1.0.4 (Feb 17, 2024)

Spice v1.0.4 improves partition pruning for Delta Lake tables, significantly increasing scan efficiency and reducing overhead. xAI tool calling is more robust and the `spice trace` CLI command now provides expanded, detailed output for deeper analysis. Additionally, a bug has been fixed to correctly apply column name case-sensitivity in refresh SQL, indexes, and primary keys.

## Highlights in v1.0.4

- **Improved Append-Based Refresh** When using an append-based acceleration where the `time_column` format differs from the physical partition, two new dataset configuration options, `time_partition_column` and `time_partition_format` can be configured to improve partition pruning and exclude irrelevant partitions during the refreshes.

For example, when the `time_column` format is `timestamp` and the physical data partition is `date` such as below:

```shell
my_delta_table/
├── _delta_log/
├── date_col=2023-12-31/
├── date_col=2024-02-04/
├── date_col=2025-01-01/
└── date_col=2030-06-15/
```

Partition pruning can be optimized using the configuration:

```yaml
datasets:
  - from: delta_lake://my_delta_table
    name: my_delta_table
    time_column: created_at # A fine-grained timestamp
    time_format: timestamp
    time_partition_column: date_col # Data is physically partitioned by `date_col`
    time_partition_format: date
sgrebnov marked this conversation as resolved.
```

- **Expanded `spice trace` output**: The `spice trace` CLI command now includes additional details, such as task status, and optional flags `--include-input` and `--include-output` for detailed tracing.

Example `spice trace` output:

```console
TREE                   STATUS DURATION   TASK
a97f52ccd7687e64       ✅       673.14ms ai_chat

  └── 4c9049e1bf1c3500 ✅       671.91ms ai_completion
```

Example `spice trace --include-input --include-output` output:

```console
TREE                   STATUS DURATION   TASK                    OUTPUT
