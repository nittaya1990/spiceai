## Planning Checklist

- [ ] Review the specific [GitHub Milestone](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/milestones).
- [ ] Ensure all related Issues and PRs are correctly labeled.
- [ ] Confirm no high-priority security or performance Issues remain open.
- [ ] Communicate the feature freeze date to all contributors.
- [ ] **If this is a patch release (vX.Y.Z)**: Verify no backward-incompatible changes.
- [ ] **If this is a patch release**: Plan to cherry-pick each relevant commit into the release branch.
- [ ] **If this is a minor release (vX.Y)**: Plan to merge commit from `trunk` into the release branch.

## Release Branch Creation

- [ ] Create a release branch (`release/X.Y`) from `trunk` one day before the scheduled release (if not already created).
  - Refer to [docs/RELEASE.md](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/blob/trunk/docs/RELEASE.md) for more details.
- [ ] If **patch release**: cherry-pick each commit to include.
- [ ] If **minor release**: merge commit from `trunk`.
- [ ] Lock the release branch to critical fixes only. Notify the team of the branch status.

## Pre-Release Testing & Validation

1. **Build Validations**

   - [ ] Ensure all builds (including the CUDA build) pass in `trunk` for at least one supported compute capability on **both Linux and Windows**.

## Release Publication Steps

- [ ] Cherry-pick release notes onto the release branch.
- [ ] Create a **pre-release** [GitHub Release](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/releases/new) with a tag (e.g. `v1.0.0-rc.1`). Leave the body empty so automation can populate it from the checked-in notes.
- [ ] Tag and release docs (e.g. `v1.0.0`) **after** the [build_and_release workflow](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/actions/workflows/build_and_release.yml) completes.
- [ ] Update the [Helm chart](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/blob/trunk/deploy/chart) (chart version & image.tag) only after:

  1. Docker build for the release branch completes (~2 hours).
  2. [Release Chart workflow](https://github.com/spiceai/helm-charts/actions/workflows/release.yml) is triggered.

- [ ] Mark the [release](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/releases) as official once all binaries and Docker images finish building.
- [ ] Perform a final test pass on the released binaries and Docker images.
- [ ] Run the following workflows to confirm installation health:
  - [ ] [Generate Spicepod JSON schema](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/actions/workflows/generate_json_schema.yml)
  - [ ] [E2E Test Release Installation](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/actions/workflows/e2e_test_release_install.yml)

## Post-Release Housekeeping

- [ ] Bump `version.txt` and `Cargo.toml` in `trunk` to the next planned release.
- [ ] Update [brew taps](https://github.com/spiceai/homebrew-spiceai) after the final build completes.
- [ ] Remove or mark the released version in the [ROADMAP](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/blob/trunk/docs/ROADMAP.md).
- [ ] Update the supported version in `SECURITY.md` if necessary.
